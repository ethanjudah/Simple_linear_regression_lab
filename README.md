Use the scikit-learn library to implement Simple linear regression. 

We download a dataset that is related to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. 

Then, we split our data into training and test sets, create a model using a training set, evaluate your model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown values.
